# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Summary
Goal of the project is to use unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

Took a csv file that had cryptocurrency data on it; I cleaned and prepared the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means. I then reduced the data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn. Then I predicted clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm fromm sklearn. And then created a 3d scatter plots and data tables to visualize my results.
